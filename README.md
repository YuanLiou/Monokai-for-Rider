# Monokai-for-Rider
Monokai color scheme for JetBrains Rider IDE.

---
## Why?
Color schemes used for other JetBrains IDE is not capable for Rider IDE currently. <br>
So, I port my monokai scheme from Android Studio. <br>
However, current color scheme setting on Rider seems like not complete, it might not look as same as other JetBrains IDEs. <br>
This color scheme is mainly for C#.
